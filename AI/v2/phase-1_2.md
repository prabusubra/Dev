# Detailed Plan – Phase 1 & Phase 2

This expands the original roadmap with a week-by-week breakdown for the first 4 months.

---

## 🔹 Phase 1: Cloud-Native Foundations (Months 1–2)

### 🎯 Goal
Move from being an AWS developer to a **cloud-native architect** who can design, deploy, and manage **Kubernetes-based microservices** with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and modern DevOps practices.

---

### **Week 1–2: Kubernetes Fundamentals**
- Learn core concepts: Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Ingress.  
- Tools: `kubectl`, `minikube` or `kind` (local K8s).  
- 📚 Resources:  
  - [Kubernetes Docs – Basics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/)  
  - *Kubernetes Up & Running* (Book).  
- ✅ Hands-on: Deploy a simple Spring Boot REST API + React app to local K8s.

---

### **Week 3: AWS EKS + ECS**
- Learn when to use EKS vs ECS.  
- Set up **EKS cluster** on AWS (use eksctl or Terraform).  
- Deploy a containerized Spring Boot service.  
- 📚 Resources:  
  - AWS Workshop: [EKS Workshop](https://www.eksworkshop.com/)  

---

### **Week 4: Helm & Package Management**
- Learn Helm charts for packaging microservices.  
- Write your own Helm chart for Spring Boot service.  
- ✅ Hands-on: Package React frontend and Spring Boot backend as Helm charts.

---

### **Week 5: Terraform for IaC**
- Basics: Providers, variables, modules, state management.  
- Build VPC + EKS cluster with Terraform.  
- 📚 Resources:  
  - [Terraform by HashiCorp](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)  

---

### **Week 6–7: GitOps & CI/CD**
- Learn GitOps: ArgoCD / Flux.  
- Integrate CI/CD (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD).  
- ✅ Hands-on:  
  - Automate Spring Boot + React deployment using GitOps.  
  - Add rolling updates & canary deployment.

---

### **Week 8: End-to-End Project**
- Deploy **Spring Boot + React microservices app** on AWS EKS with Terraform + ArgoCD.  
- Add monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana.  
- ✅ Deliverable: Production-like **Cloud-Native Demo App**.

---

## 🔹 Phase 2: AI & Generative AI Integration (Months 3–4)

### 🎯 Goal
Learn to **embed AI into enterprise apps** using LLMs, vector databases, and orchestration frameworks.

---

### **Week 9: LLM & Prompt Engineering Basics**
- Learn how LLMs work (GPT, Claude, LLaMA).  
- Study prompt design (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought).  
- 📚 Resources:  
  - [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/)  
- ✅ Hands-on: Write prompts for text summarization and Q&A.

---

### **Week 10: LLM APIs & AWS Bedrock**
- Explore OpenAI API (`chat/completions`).  
- Learn AWS Bedrock for enterprise LLM integration.  
- ✅ Hands-on: Build a **Spring Boot service that calls OpenAI API**.  

---

### **Week 11: Vector Databases**
- Learn embeddings → store in vector DB for semantic search.  
- Tools: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Amazon OpenSearch.  
- ✅ Hands-on: Create a **document search engine** with embeddings + Spring Boot.

---

### **Week 12: AI-Enhanced Features**
- Integrate chatbot/semantic search into React frontend.  
- Add authentication (OAuth2) for enterprise use.  
- ✅ Hands-on: Build **customer support chatbot** app.

---

### **Week 13: Orchestration Frameworks**
- Learn LangChain & Semantic Kernel.  
- Build multi-step workflows (retrieval, summarization, reasoning).  
- ✅ Hands-on: Use LangChain to integrate Spring Boot API + vector DB + LLM.

---

### **Week 14–16: Productionizing AI**
- Deploy AI service on AWS (ECS/EKS).  
- Add observability (logging, tracing, OpenTelemetry).  
- Optimize costs (model selection, caching).  
- ✅ Final Project: AI-powered **knowledge assistant** with Spring Boot backend + React frontend, deployed on AWS.

---

## ✅ Deliverables After Phase 1 & 2
- **Phase 1 Output**:  
  - Kubernetes-deployed Spring Boot + React app on AWS (with Terraform, Helm, GitOps, Observability).  
- **Phase 2 Output**:  
  - AI-powered chatbot/search assistant integrated into your stack (Spring Boot + React + AWS Bedrock/OpenAI + Vector DB).
